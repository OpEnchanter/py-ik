This is a simple inverse kinematics solver I made in python.

Inverse kinematics is a system of equations that solves for the angles of joints to move a set of linkages to a certain point while keeping the linkages always the same length. This is used often in robotics and with robots that have legs to give the script a position relative to the robot and the robot will attempt to move its leg to the specified point.
